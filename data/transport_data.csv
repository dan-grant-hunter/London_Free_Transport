Freedom of my mind to not have to worry about using my parents’ already very low finances. In September, I will officially start year 13 - the year decides if I will be able to make my dream come true which is going to university and financially supporting myself. During this year even though it is still the most important year of my life, I will still have to work to support my parents and I will have to travel to many places to gain experiences for my UCAS application. Without the generous free unlimited transport, I possibly don’t see how I can fund these. You may say : ‘Don’t you work?’. Yes, yes I do work but that money goes to my parents straight away without hesitation, they need it a lot more than me to support our family of 6. So free transport to me is a luxury that I am privileged to have obtained but I also understand the governments decision, the pandemic have dissected the economy and dispersed them into pieces which will be hard to bring together unless they think outside the box. So I understand but I’m sure many of the youths and their families will be devastated, some children’s families condition are so bad they may even have to change schools away from their friends after not seeing them for so long or at the very extreme length not even attend school.

The collage i am enroling in is a train and bus ride away. I will go from paying 19 pounds to 72 pounds a month just to get to collage 3 days a week. This does not include extra tuition days or work experience days. Also getting to my therapy services such as camhs will be alot harder as the though of trying to save money will increse an already anxiety provoking ride. I cannot afford to pay to 72 pounds a month to get to collage so am relying that i get financial support.,5,5,1,1,5,5,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,I would probably restric the extra days i go to collage and be less motivated to attend my therapy.

Once they’re able to make their own stable income it would make sense to then pay. They need a stable life. Paying for travel whilst being under 18 could cause severe poverty and trouble for many people. Not everyone has cars, or thry are unable to drive or find parking in the places they need to get to, or they only have one car which is in use by another family memeber for work and they cannot afford another car. Free transport is one of the many important things that need to be kept. I have a strong view on this issue that it would cause many problems. The ‘free travel’ process is running smoothly already so why stop it? Its only going to cause problems which you’ll need to find more solutions to. And in order for those solutions to be placed it takes a lot of time.
